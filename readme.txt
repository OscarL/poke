/*
   A "poke" replacement. Any resemblance, and difference, with the original is
   absolutely intentional.

   Thanks to:
   - Eric Huss for his "The C Library Reference Guide".
   - Snippets.org
   - readline/editline's "fileman" sample program.
   - Rudolf Cornelissen for the testing and suggestions.

   ToDo(s):
   - Better scripting than "cat commands.txt | poke - > output.txt" ?
   - Better command completion (complete arguments from history, for example).
   - New commands to force reads/writes to protected areas?
   - Only one command for virtual/physical addresses?
   - Fix the Broken English in the help and comments.
